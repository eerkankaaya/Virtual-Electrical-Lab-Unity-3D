Electric Machinery Laboratuvary Implementation-Coding-Simulation. I would like to mention that for my graduation project titled 'Virtual Electrical Laboratory' at the Eski≈üehir Technical University Electrical and Electronics Engineering department, which is 100% in English, I used Unity 3D for the simulation and coded using C# scripts, integrating both seamlessly. The Project Photos file contains some of the simulations and code examples that I have entirely created myself.THE PROJECT FILE COULD NOT BE UPLOADED BECAUSE IT IS LARGER THAN 2GB SIZE!!!
